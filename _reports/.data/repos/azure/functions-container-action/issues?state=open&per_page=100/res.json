      "body": "Is this action currently supported for deploying a custom container based function app to Azure? If I use deployment center in Azure to setup github actions, it generates an action that uses \"azure/webapps-deploy@v2\", not this action. That leads me to believe that either this action is defunct or the deployment center has a bug. The other issue is that this action has not been updated to use \"publish-profile\" which both functions-action and webapps-deploy support. I've tried using webapps-deploy and it seems to work fine for deploying to the production slot, but does not work for me when deploying to a different slot. I'd appreciate any advice on where to go with this.",
